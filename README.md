# evolve-atari
Evolution of AI for playing Atari games (we start with Boxing game) using Cartesian Genetic Programming. The (python) implementation is derived from [Evolving simple programs for playing Atari games](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05695), originally written in Julia. Used CGP library is [cartesian](https://github.com/ohjeah/cartesian), Atari environement is provided by [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/).

This is a source code of the project for Evolutionary Computing course at RMIT.

## Installation
Make sure you have `python3.7` installed. Then install requirements with:

`pip3.7 install -r requirements.txt`

## Training

In `src/` folder, a framework for training programs for openAI environments using Cartesian Genetic Programming is implemented. To perform training on Atari game (Boxing game by default), just run:

`python3.7 atari_evolve.py [RANDOM_STATE]`

where `[RANDOM_STATE]` is optional. You can also specify training parameters in `atari_config_file.py`, CGP functions pool in `atari_primitive_set.py` and review all available CGP functions in `cgp_functions.py`.

## Testing

To test your trained program, call:

`python3.7 atari_test.py [PATH_TO_PICKLE] [TIMESTEPS] [time.sleep() ARGUMENT]`

where `[PATH_TO_PICKLE]` is path to saved program (by default in `pickles/` folder) and `[TIMESTEPS]` specify the maximal length of the game (positive integer). Optional argument `[time.sleep() ARGUMENT]` specifies the time sleep between every TIMESTEP, if not provided, sleep is not called.

Files with `cartpole_` prefix show our CGP framework on a simple CartPole example.

## Preliminary experiments
Jupyter notebook `preliminary_experiments.ipynb` contains our simple implementation of evolutionary algorithm with tournament selection method, crossover using the blending method and mutation. It is used to evolve a weight vector for linear model of simple CartPole environment.

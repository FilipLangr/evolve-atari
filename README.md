# evolve-atari
Evolution of AI for playing Atari games (we start with Boxing game) using Cartesian Genetic Programming. The (python) implementation is derived from [Evolving simple programs for playing Atari games](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.05695), originally written in Julia. Used CGP library is [cartesian](https://github.com/ohjeah/cartesian), Atari environement is provided by [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/).

This is a source code of the project for Evolutionary Computing course at RMIT.
